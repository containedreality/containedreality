# containedreality
Hello! I am containedreality. I am a programmer primarily interested in UNIX, BSD and Linux systems,
though I am focused on [Debian](https://debian.org/).

I am generally interested with cybersecurity, relatively low level UNIX-like software (Init and other utils for example)
, and networking.

# Tools
Operating system: Usually [Debian (Stable)](https://debian.org/) but in some uses [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org)

Shell: [fish](https://fishshell.com/)

Text Editor: [neovim](https://neovim.io/)

IDE: [radare2](https://rada.re/) + [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) + [neovim](https://neovim.io/)

# Programming languages
I mainly use Ruby, Shell script (either Bash or POSIX depending on target) or C++ depending on the task at hand.

But I also some *some* experience in Go, Python, Java, C#, Javascript, Assembly (NASM).

# Extra
You can find my configuration files at [here](https://github.com/containedreality/configs).

You can also find my openbox configuration at [here](https://github.com/containedreality/openbox-config),
however I shall note that I don't really use it much, and only have it here for the few times that I do use it for example in a virtual machine or on a laptop.

I should note I no longer maintain or push to these repositories as I have switched to a local git repository for hosting these.
